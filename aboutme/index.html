    <h2>Tyler Justesen</h2>
    <p>I am a Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) major. I am a senior and will be graduating in July. I have been married 5 years now and have a son who is turnig 2 years old this month. 
    Currently I am working as a drafter at an architecture firm called ALC Architecture. I am hoping to change jobs though and work with a company that is willing to use my VDC knowledge.</p>
